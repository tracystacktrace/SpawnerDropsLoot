# SpawnerDropsLoot

![Mod Logo](https://github.com/tracystacktrace/SpawnerDropsLoot/raw/main/src/master/docs/icon.png)

While attempting to play through a challenge in my NFC world, I end up struggling over spawner-based mob farms.
Entities spawned by spawners don't drop any loot, which is not good!
I understand this is an intentional design choice, but in some situations this choice may cause more struggles.

This mod aims to return loot drops of entities spawned in spawners.
